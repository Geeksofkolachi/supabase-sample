## 🔦📓 Supabase Vs Firebase

### Database

- Firestore allows you to store “documents”. These are collections of key:value pairs where the value can be another sub-document. Document based storage is perfect for unstructured data, since two documents in a collection do not necessarily need to have the same structure.

- Supabase is an open source firebase alternative, but instead of being built around a document-based datastore, Supabase offers a relational database management system called PostgreSQL.

### Real-time updates

- Firebase offers real-time updates using WebSockets.
- Supabase offers real-time updates using PostgreSQL's built-in real-time notifications.

### Integrations

- Firebase offers integrations with several Google services, including Google Analytics and Google Cloud Functions.
- Supabase has fewer integrations but provides extensive support for PostgreSQL features and libraries.

### Pricing

- Firebase has a free tier that allows a limited number of users.
- Supabase is completely open-source and free to use

However, if you need to scale your application, you'll need to pay for additional resources on both platforms.
